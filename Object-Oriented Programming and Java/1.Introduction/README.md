# 1. Distinguish the Programming Approach Used in Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming  

**Procedural programming** follows a sequential approach to solving problems, executing steps in a linear order.  
In contrast, **object-oriented programming (OOP)** structures the problem by organizing it into objects and classes, promoting modularity and reusability.

# 2. Discuss the Validity of the Following Statement:  
## *The object-oriented programming approach is ideal for simulating real-world problems.*  

Yes, because the core concept of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** is to model everything as an object, similar to how we perceive the real world.  
In reality, everything is an object with specific **properties** and **behaviors**.  
OOP allows us to classify objects into **groups (classes)** based on shared properties and methods, making it an ideal approach for **simulating real-world problems**.

# 3. Consider the Following Scenarios and Outline the Objects and Their Interactions in Terms of Messages and Arguments:  

### (a) A driver driving a car  
```java
 drive(carModel, licensePlate, carColor)
```

### (b) A customer making a cash withdrawal from an automated teller machine (ATM)  
```java
 withdraw(amount)
```

### (c) A customer buying a compact disk player from a vendor  
```java
 buy(cdPlayerBrand, price)
```

### (d) A traffic policeman directing traffic at a junction  
```java
 directTraffic(trafficSignal, duration, direction)
```

### (e) A lecturer delivering his/her lecture to a class of students  
```java
 teach(courseName, duration, date)
```

### (f) A tutorial discussion between an instructor and students  
```java
 discuss(topic, duration, studentQuestions)
```
